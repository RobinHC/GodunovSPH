## 04/08/2012:

* Large refactor of the Riemann Solver classes to encompass namespacing for flow constants, as well as introducing encapsulated StateVectors for tuples of flow properties.

## 10/03/2012:

* Added the beginnings of a 1D first order Godunov solver, CGodunov1DSolverEulerBase, making use of the exact Riemann solver (slow!)

## 26/02/2012:

* Completed 1D CRiemannSolverEulerBase and CRiemannSolverEulerExact, although comments and explanation need to be added.
