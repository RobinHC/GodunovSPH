GodunovSPH is a Computational Fluid Dynamics library for modelling compressible flows in physics and engineering. In particular, it enables numerical experimentation in aeronautics, astronautics and astrophysics. 

Languages:

 * The core solver routines will be writtin C++
 * Depending upon complexity, pre- and post-analysis data manipulation will be written in Python

Roadmap:

 * A RiemannSolver abstract base class will be created first
 * An 'exact' solver, plus approximate solvers, and HLLC/HLLE will be added
 * For second order schemes, a Generalised Riemann Problem (GRP) solver will be constructed (based on Ben-Artzi and Falcovitz)
 * A 2D second order Godunov scheme, using structured meshes, will be constructed to test the Riemann solvers
 * Once the Godunov solvers are considered robust, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics implementation will begin
