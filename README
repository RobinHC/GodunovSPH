GodunovSPH is a Computational Fluid Dynamics library for modelling compressible flows in physics and engineering. In particular, it enables numerical experimentation in aeronautics, astronautics and astrophysics. It is based on a Generalsed Riemann Solver/Godunov Finite Volume Algorithm for shocks as well as Smooth Particle Hydronamics for astrophysical flow modelling.

Languages:

 * The core solver routines will be writtin C++
 * Depending upon complexity, pre- and post-analysis data manipulation will be written in Python

Roadmap:

 * A RiemannSolver abstract base class will be created first
 * An 'exact' solver, plus approximate solvers, and HLLC/HLLE solvers will be added
 * For second order schemes, a Generalised Riemann Problem (GRP) solver will be constructed (based on Ben-Artzi and Falcovitz)
 * A 2D second order Godunov scheme, using structured meshes, will be constructed to test the Riemann solvers
 * An unstructured mesh finite volume scheme will then be created to test the GRP on irregular geometries
 * A smoothed particle hydrodynamics code will be implemented that will utilise the GRP for flow discontinuities (shocks/contact discontinuities)

Current status (26/02/2012):

 * Completed 1D CRiemannSolverEulerBase and CRiemannSolverEulerExact, although comments and explanation need to be added.
